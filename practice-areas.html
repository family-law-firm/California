<h3>Family Law</h3>
<h4>Guardianship</h4>
<p>Guardianship occurs when a court orders someone other than the child’s parent to take custody of the child. It is a difficult decision to have a child raised by anyone other than the parent, but there are certain situations where the court needs to step in and decide what is best for the child.</p>
<p>There are different types of guardianship that can be provided, and parents can even have parental rights and reasonable contact with the child. A guardian can be a close family member, a friend of the family, any court-appointed individual or someone deemed suitable by the court who asked for guardianship rights. If the parent should become eligible to take care of the child again, the guardianship can end. Guardianship attorneys can help navigate a myriad of legal concerns for parents and discuss the two types of probate guardianships available:</p>
<p>Guardianship of the Person — Guardian has full and legal physical custody, which means he/she makes all of the physical decisions to care for the child like a parent and is responsible for any intentional damage that the child may cause.</p>
<p>Guardianship of the Estate — Guardian manages the child’s income, money or other property until he/she turns 18. This may be used when a child inherits notable wealth, investments and/or other assets.</p>
<h4>Child Custody</h4>
<p>The dissolution of marriage — regardless of financial, social or cultural background — affects children the most. Some of the most important strides in decision making during a divorce proceeding is the preparation and drafting of a custody agreement for the minor children involved.</p>
<p>International child custody laws can differ for each family situation and from state to state. It’s important to know the different types of custody rights available, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joint Legal Custody — Each parent shares the responsibility of deciding on important decisions like education, religion, health, living and travel arrangements.</li>
<li>Joint Physical Custody — A determination of who the child will live with or who will be the primary custodial parent. Supervised Visitation — A neutral third party present during a parent’s visitation hours.</li>
<li>Sole Legal Custody — One parent has sole responsibility for deciding how to raise the child without the need to consult the other parent.</li>
<li>Sole Physical Custody — The child will live with one parent for the majority of the time.</li>
<li>Grandparent Visitation Rights — If you are a grandparent, you may want to know your rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>Custody attorneys advocate for placing the needs of children and families first. Our international family law attorneys understand the complexities of each child’s experience during a divorce proceeding and can offer legal advice, protective counsel and guidance for family members.</p>
<h4>Family Law Services</h4>
<p>The family law practice encompasses a range of issues families face, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Divorce and martial separation</li>
<li>International Child custody</li>
<li>Guardianship</li>
<li>Division of property</li>
<li>Restraining orders</li>
<li>Adoption</li>
</ul>
<p>Our attorneys are well prepared to navigate the diverse laws governing marriage in other countries.</p>
<h3>Divorce</h3>
<h4>International Divorce</h4>
<p>Our divorce lawyer team have vast experience in dealing with the inconsistent legal systems of different nations, especially in instances where there is no case law in a particular country or where an issue arises as to which county’s law controls the case.</p>
<h4>Collaborative Divorce</h4>
<p>When a couple is looking to proceed with the dissolution of a marriage, they should be aware of the different divorce options that they may want to pursue. One alternative option to a typical divorce proceeding is a collaborative divorce. The collaborative divorce combines mediation and litigation alternatives to allow the parties an opportunity to have a more peaceful, cost-effective and non-contested dissolution of marriage.</p>
<p>Some important key benefits of a collaborative divorce:</p>
<ul>
<li>No court involvement — All parties involved agree that no one will pursue litigation. Instead, all parties work together to formulate an agreement that is in the best interest of each party.</li>
<li>Use of experts — Each party hires his/her own team — attorneys and, possibly psychologists — who will be representatives throughout the process. Oftentimes, a jointly retained financial accountant is used to assist in the division of all financial assets and property. Both parties share these expenses.</li>
<li>Disclosure — There must be complete disclosure provided by both sides outlining all assets, property, debts and other important factors. Nothing is kept hidden from the other party in this process.</li>
</ul>
<h4>California Divorce</h4>
<p>Divorce can involve difficult and complex matters for families, especially when children are involved, when couples have high net worth, or when couples have citizenship in different nations. Various factors can play a crucial part in determining the complexity, duration and cost of filing for a divorce in California. It is important to know what you will need when preparing to file for a divorce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay stubs and tax returns</li>
<li>Credit card and loan statements</li>
<li>Monthly bills</li>
<li>Date of the marriage</li>
<li>Date of separation</li>
<li>Visitation logs</li>
</ul>
<h4>High-Net-Worth Divorce</h4>
<p>Most high-net-worth divorce cases include more property and assets that will need reviewing, as well as specialized documentation outlining the types of accounts, property and assets an individual may have prior to, during and after the marital union. These types of investments include stock portfolios, domestic and offshore bank accounts, real estate investment properties, business ownership, pensions, 401k funds and IRA portfolios.</p>
<h4>Legal Separation</h4>
<p>One of the hardest decisions a family can make is deciding to petition for a legal separation. It can create financial hardship and place stress on the individual parties, not to mention the child involved. Attorneys who specialize in legal separation law can explain your rights and help you understand the complexities that occur during the process.</p>
<p>California has very specific and complex rules about how the defendant receives the papers in a legal separation proceeding. It may be best for you to hire an attorney who can help guide you through this process.</p>
<h4>Division of Property</h4>
<p>In California, property division and debt issues are settled in a Marital Settlement Agreement, or the property awarding is court ordered by the Superior Court within the Final Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage. California is considered a “community property state,” meaning that property and debt acquired during the marriage until the official marriage end date will be split equally.</p>
<p>Our international divorce lawyers can be extremely helpful in cases that involve one or more pension plans, which can be more valuable than any or all assets combined.</p>
<h3>Intellectual Property Law</h3>
<h4>Patent</h4>
<p>A grant made by the government that confers upon the creator of an invention (the “inventor”) the sole right to make, use, and sell that invention for a set period of time (20 years from filing under the US system).</p>
<h4>Patent Prosecution</h4>
<p>The back-and-forth correspondence with the U.S. Patent Office that includes the filing of a patent application being filed by the inventor or his/her representative agent, a search by the Patent Office, rejections, responses, and potentially an allowance of the patent application by the Patent Office, resulting in a granted patent.</p>
<h4>Trademark</h4>
<p>A trademark is a word, phrase, symbol or design, or a combination thereof, that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods or services of one party from those of others.</p>
<h4>Copyright/Licensing</h4>
<p>A copyright protects works of authorship, such as writings, music, and works of art that have been tangibly expressed.</p>
<h4>IP Litigation</h4>
<p>When a patent is infringed (i.e., one or more claims of a patent cover a product or process that has not been licensed under that patent), the enforcement of the patent in the federal courts constitutes patent litigation. A trademark or copyright may also be infringed, and may be enforced by a state or federal court action.</p>
<h4>U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB)</h4>
<p>The PTAB is an office within the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) responsible for hearing and deciding appeals from the patent Examiners, as well as for deciding reexaminations. Decisions of the PTAB may, in turn, be appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC).</p>
<h4>U.S. Patent and Trademark Office Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB)</h4>
<p>The TTAB is an office within the USPTO responsible for hearing and deciding appeals from the trademark Examiners, as well as for deciding trademark opposition and cancellation proceedings. Decisions of the TTAB may, in turn, be appealed to the CAFC.</p>
<h4>Appeal</h4>
<p>An appeal is a process for requesting a formal change to an official decision. The initial decision- maker who is appealed may be a court, a board, a tribunal or even a single official. Generally speaking, in the court system an official decision may be affirmed (the reviewing court agrees with the decision); reversed (the reviewing court disagrees with the decision, and overturns it); or remanded (the reviewing court sends the case back to the lower court or tribunal).</p>
<h4>Branding/Naming</h4>
<p>This is the detailed process of naming a product. Naming a product is very important to branding. The process may include identifying the objectives of branding, developing a product name, evaluating names through market testing and focus groups, choosing a final product name, and identifying it as a trademark.</p>
<h4>Breach of Contract and Unfair Competition Breach</h4>
<p>Breach of contract is a failure, without legal excuse, to perform any promise that forms all or part of the contract. This includes failure to perform in a manner that meets the standards of the industry or the requirements of any express warranty or implied warranty. Often, breach of contract occurs, unfair competition has also occurred. Unfair competition applies to dishonest or fraudulent rivalry in trade and commerce. One example of unfair competition relates to the substituting of one’s own goods or products in the market for those of another for the purpose of deceiving the public.</p>
<h4>False Advertising</h4>
<p>This is the use of false or misleading statements in advertising. In the United States, advertising is regulated by the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts or practices in commerce.</p>
<h4>Trade Secrets</h4>
<p>Generally, any confidential business information which provides that business a competitive edge may be considered a trade secret. Trade secrets encompass manufacturing or industrial secrets and commercial secrets. The unauthorized use of such information by persons other than the holder is regarded as an unfair practice and a violation of the trade secret. In the United States there are many ways to protect trade secrets.</p>

<p>One of the most challenging scenarios for a family is the need for a restraining order, or protective order, which protects an individual from being physically or sexually abused, harassed, threatened or stalked by another person. Our attorneys can prepare agreements for different types of restraining orders, including:</p>
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
<ol>
<li>Personal Conduct Order — Stops the restrained person from doing certain physical acts like contacting, attacking, threatening, harassing and stalking the protected individual.</li>
<li>Stay-Away Orders — Keeps the restrained person a certain distance away from the protected person’s work, home, vehicle and, if applicable, child’s school/child care location.</li>
<li>Residence Exclusion (“Kick-Out” or “Move-Out”) Orders — Enforces that the restrained person moves out of where the protected person lives, asking that they only take their clothing and personal belongings until the court hearing.</li>
</ol>
</div>
